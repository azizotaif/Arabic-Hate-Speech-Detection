# Arabic Hate Speech Detection

In this project, I fine-tuned BERT to detect Arabic hate/toxic speech on multiple Arabic hate speech datasets.

## Datasets
The model is trained on a combination of 5 datasets:
- [Multilingual and Multi-Aspect Hate Speech Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11049)
- [Arabic Levantine Hate Speech Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haithemhermessi/arabic-levantine-hate-speech-detection)
- [L-HSAB Dataset](https://aclanthology.org/W19-3512/)
- [Abusive Language Detection on Arabic Social Media (Twitter)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-3008)
- [Dataset Construction for the Detection of Anti-Social Behaviour in Online Communication in Arabic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918321756)
